# Overview

This is the documentation of the companion code for the paper **TODO**, which presents a novel approach for Literature-Based Discovery. The approach relies on contrasting different "views" of the data, the data being the biomedical literature (Medline and PubMed Central). The experiments use 8 relations which correspond to past discoveries in the domain of Neurodegenerative Diseases (NDs).

- The paper can be found at **TODO**
- The code is available at https://github.com/erwanm/lbd-contrast



## Data Requirements

### Short Reproducility Study

For convenience the fully preprocessed dataset used in the paper is provided here **TODO**. The user should be able to reproduce the results presented in the paper by following the instructions below starting from the step **TODO**.

### Full Replication

In this option it is possible to apply the contrast method to different source data and/or different target relations. However this requires (much) more effort and computational resources:

- This study uses two source for the biomedical literature:
    - [PubTatorCentral](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/) conveniently provides Medline/PMC data after annotation and disambiguation. This data still needs to be converted to TDC format and pre-processed using The [TDC Tools code](https://github.com/erwanm/tdc-tools).
    - The raw Medline/PMC data can be converted to TDC and disambiguated using the following tools:
        - [This fork of the Knowedge Discovery (KD) repository](https://github.com/erwanm/knowledgediscovery) (The [original code](https://github.com/jakelever/knowledgediscovery) was made by Jake Lever)
        - The in-house disambiguation code ["KD Data Tools"](https://github.com/erwanm/kd-data-tools)

## Software Requirements

- This code requires R and a few R libraries: 
    - `reshape2`
    - `ggplot2`
    - `plyr`

## Hardware Requirements

Only reproducing the study](#simple-reproducibility) should work on any recent computer. However the [full replication](#full-replication) requires massive resources for computing the source data, and at least 32 GB RAM for processing the data from scratch with the R code. 

# R Markdown

## R Markdown 2

### R Markdown 3

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
