## Overview

The tools below propose an interactive interface to explore relations between some neurodegenerative concepts extracted from the biomedical literature. The tools are prototypes for a new literature-based discovery method presented in **[pending]**. 

- [Associated concepts by ND target](baseline-view/) ([documentation](baseline-view.user-guide/))
- [Contrast two Datasets given a Target Concept](contrast-views/) ([documentation](contrast-views.user-guide/))


The code for the contrast method can be found in [this github repository](https://github.com/erwanm/lbd-contrast).
